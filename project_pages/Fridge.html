<h1> ConnectFridge: Interactive Fridge for Reducing Food Waste </h1>

From food banks to soup kitchens, scarcity of food is not a new problem.
Yet paradoxically, food waste is also a wide issue. Using 2008 metrics, 
it is estimated that every year in the United States, 124 kilograms of food is wasted per person. 
Similarly, for 2011, the total monetary waste from consumers comes out to be around $124 billion, 
or a wasted $400 a year per person. However it is not just an economic issue, there are wider implications; 
in the United States, avoidable food waste accounts for about 2% of the national emissions. 
Trying to understand why food waste occurs has been the topic of many research papers, from analyzing campaign
techniques to consumer habits. Interestingly enough, previous literature has found that shopping routines and financial concerns 
are main variables in determining food waste on the side of the consumer. 
Because this problem has been analyzed in a variety of ways, we wanted to provide a unique perspective, specifically using gratitude as a lens. 
We realized that shopping routines and monetary spending that cause more food waste both stem from not knowing what is in your fridge. 
Thus, we focused our efforts on building a fridge interface that improved these habits in a minimally invasive way.

We were inspired to create a fridge with a transparent door that would show the users the content of the fridge. 
Our design inspiration for this came from the “In my Fridge” design by Fabian Kreuzer.
This fridge shows the users the contents of the fridge through an interface that imitates the inside of the fridge and provides 
users with a system to manage the fridge. Other methods that have been used to reduce food waste are mobile applications that 
show an up-to-date food inventory list. Another design we found was Bubble, which also incorporates transparency to visually show 
the users their food items and comes with a food management interface system. Finally, because we want to incorporate a connective 
element to increase the connection to the food we have in our fridge, we found a persuasive design article involving botanical art. 
Using these designs, we began our iteration of our interface.
