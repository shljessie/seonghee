  I research ways humans and AI can interact effectively with each other. Specifically, I aim to create interfaces that can help anyone understand and criticize faulty AI systems and improve them. Here are my 2 main avenues of research interest :
</p>
<br/>
  <p>
  (1) Explainble AI :  Improving the communication of machine learning systems in order to make them more publicly understandable (Explainable AI, XAI)
</p>
<br/>
<p>
  (2) Implicit Interaction :  Helping AI systems understand the nuances of Human Implicit Interaction
</p> 
<br/>
